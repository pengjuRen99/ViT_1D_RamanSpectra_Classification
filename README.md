# One-Dimensional Multi-head Attention Mechanism Neural Network for Species Blood and Semen Identification from Raman Spectroscopy
## Animal blood and semen analysis using Raman Spectroscopy
## Propose a Raman Spectroscopy classification network based on Transformer structure
## Identification of blood and semen from 52 animal species by reflection and transmission Raman Spectroscopy
Compared with the classic machine learning classification algorithms and the multilayer neural network models proposed by other scholars, 
the result shows that the average accuracy of our model can reach 98.3% for the reflection spectrum dataset and 98.4% for the transmission 
spectrum dataset.

There are two versions of the network structure, tensorflow and pytorch.
